I want to learn Go and I want you to be my tutor. What I want you to do is create a path for me to follow in order to learn the language. the path must be devided into 3 levels: easy, intermediate and advanced. For each difficulty level create a folder and for each subject create a .go file inside the folder. In each file I want you to write a starting comment that explains on of the subjects about the go programming language, and then a few exercises to cement the knowladge that I have acquired. Create as many files as you need. Imagine that I have no access to the documentation, so you need to explain every concept that I need to use in the exercises. #codebase #upstash/context7
